<h1>Bitcoin Relay Network</h1>
<p>P2P network serves general needs of a variety of nodes,
  it exhibits too high network latency fot the specialized needs of bitcoin nodes,</p>
<p>Mining nodes competes to mine. In that case, network latency directly affect profit margins.</p>
<p>A Bitcoin Relay Network is a network that attempts to minimize the latency in the transmission</p>
