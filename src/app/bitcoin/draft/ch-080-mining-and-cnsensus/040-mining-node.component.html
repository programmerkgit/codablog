<h1>The process of Transaction accumulation</h1>
<p>Get Transaction from another node</p>
<p>Put Transactions into transaction pool</p>
<p>construct to candidate block</p>
<p>Start Mining and accumulate transactions for next candidate block</p>
<p>If received new block, remove transactions in the block from transaction pool.</p>
<p>Accumulate transactions and make candidate block again</p>
<p>When Jim found the solution to proof of work, that block is validated</p>
