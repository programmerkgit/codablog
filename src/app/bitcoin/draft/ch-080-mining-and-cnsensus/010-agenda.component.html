<h1>What is Mining</h1>
<p>The mining expresses that you can get bitcoin through the computing, but the primary purpose of mining
  is not to create bitcoin. Mining is the invention that makes bitcoin special, a decentralized security mechanism that
  is the basis for P2P digital cash.
</p>
<p>Mining secures the network and enables network-wide consensus without a central authenticity.
  Reward of bitcoin is the incentive mechanism for mining, by which decentralized security is archived.
</p>

<h2>What miners do</h2>
<p>Miners validate transactions and blocks and record then in the global ledger, blockchain.</p>
<p>A new block containing transactions that occurred since the last block is mined and recorded to the blockchain
  every ten minutes on average.</p>
<p>Transaction that become part of the block and recorded in the blockchain are considered confirmed,
  which allows new owner to spend the bitcoin they received in those transactions.
</p>

<h2>Two Types of rewards miners get.</h2>
<p>Miners get two types of rewards in return for the security provided by mining.</p>
<p>One is the transaction fee.</p>
<p>CoinBase transaction, which is a new generated bitcoin for each created new block.</p>
<p>To earn new bitcoin, Miners compete to solve difficult mathematical problem based on cryptographic hashing algorithm,
  which is called "proof of work". And the solution of this problem is
  included in the block as the proof that the block is expended on significant computing resource.
